This project is related to medical data (Patients)  analysis with neural network models (Sequentials, Dense) along with an easy and thorough prediction of several clusters.

**Tools:**

1) Excel
2) Power BI
3) Google Colab
4) Git
5) Azure ML Studio

 ** Language:****
   Python

**Required IDE:**

Microsoft Excel
Power BI Desktop
Github Desktop

**Instructions:**
1) First open dataset in google colab or jupyter notebook
2) Import all libaries and system for futher analysation and visualisations
3) Create dataframe as per as requirements
4) if needed, can user gen AI supporting at cloab now for plot visualising and others.
5) after that, split train and test data corresponding to 80% and 20%.
6) Initialize models with sequential and dense (8,3,3)
7)
